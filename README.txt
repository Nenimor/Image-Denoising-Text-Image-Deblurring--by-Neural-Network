Image Denoising & Text Image Deblurring- by Neural Network, implemented in Python (Image Processing course)

In this project I developed a general workflow for training convolutional neural networks to restore corrupted images, and then apllied it on two different tasks: image denoising, image deblurring.
The network I implemented is based on the ResNet architecture.
The data set it was trained on was created by apllying blurring and noise-adding functions on a big set of different images.
